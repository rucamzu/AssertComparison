# Comparison of C# assertion libraries

This repository is a side-by-side comparison of the following unit testing assertion libraries:

- MSTest (built-in)
- [NUnit (classic model)](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/assertions/assertion-models/classic.html)
- [NUnit (constraint model)](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/assertions/assertion-models/constraint.html)
- xUnit
- [FluentAssertions](http://www.fluentassertions.com/introduction)
- [Shouldly](https://docs.shouldly.org/)

Both FluentAssertions and Shouldly are used within MSTest unit tests.
